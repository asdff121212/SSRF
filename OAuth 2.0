oAuth 2.0 terminology
--> Resource Owner --> means user user 
--> Client --> client is the application that want to get the information from Google
-> Authorization Server --> it is the server that gives permission to authorize like accounts.google.com by entering email and password.
--> Resource Server --> Resource server is the server where resources is stored.
--> Authorization grant -->  it means it gives the grant to access the resources.
-->Redirect URI --> this is the uri where does client goes after getting resources like /useradminpage4
-->Access token --> authorization grant does many things but in higher level access token is the key that say what resource does i granted.



--> Here, user click in "connect with google" in example.com the the request is going to ther authorization server where user enter gmail and password for authorization with that it also 
provide redirect Uri to authorization server and inaback authorization server gives Response type: code , after that google server prompts allow for resources(yes or no) then after alowing it redirect to redirect URI, 
the client does not do many things with authorization code but the client ask authorization server hey i need access token and to get the access token it must provide the authorization code, authorization server validates the code and give   
token. Now the client can interact with resources server for data by using access token.
--> Firstly, what client is requested to access the resources based on that token is given . ex if client first want to access contacts but later want to access other information , the server doesnt give permission.
